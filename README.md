# About Me 
## Name: Brian Payne
- Where am I from?
- What do I enjoy doing?
- What are some of my goals?

I was born in California but after two years moved to fruita Colorado where I have stayed until now. I really enjoy playing volleyball. I am also a fan of old arcitecture. After serving my mission in Portugal I feel I have developed an appriciation for older building that we do not get to experience much in the states due to how young the coutry is. Some of my goals are to one day live on the Azores Islands. It was one of the areas on my mission and I can honestly say that I fell in love with the history of the island. 
Also I really like working with others on cool and unique projects.
